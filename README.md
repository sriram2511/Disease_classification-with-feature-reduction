# Medical Condition Prediction Classifier

## Abstract

The continuous evolution of data technologies in biomedical and healthcare domains has highlighted the importance of precise medical data analysis for early disease recognition, improved patient care, and community services. This project addresses challenges related to incomplete medical data and regional variations in disease presentations, which can impact the accuracy of disease outbreak predictions. We investigate advanced techniques for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to enhance the performance of a machine learning classifier for predicting medical conditions based on symptoms.

## Methodology

Our approach incorporates several advanced techniques to improve classification accuracy:

- **Feature Selection**: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Mutual Information, Information Gain, and LASSO.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized to enhance classifier performance.

We utilized a dataset with 132 symptoms for classifying 42 diseases. Given that requesting all these symptoms from individuals in a real-world scenario is impractical, our methodology emphasizes feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization to make the model more deployable.
The project includes scripts for:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model training and evaluation
